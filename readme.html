👋 Hi there! I'm Anne. I'm a statistician located in Richmond, Virginia, USA. 
📈 I recieved my M.S. in Applied Statistics from Villanova University in 2016 and have over a decade of experience with data analysis (started pre-grad school).
🐕🐕 When I'm not doing statistics, I'm hanging out with my wife and our two dogs-- Bandit and Brodie. ❤️
